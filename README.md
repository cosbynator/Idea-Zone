= Idea Zone =

Idea Zone is an iPhone application that lets you jot down notes
and have them immediately synced to Dropbox. 

App URL: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idea-zone/id795927539

== Open Source ==
I've scrubbed the credentials from "AIBConstants.cpp" - you'll
have to create your own Dropbox app and plop them in.

This project also uses Cocoapods for dependency management.
Use `pod install` to install everything required.
